## Investigation Log

### Day 1 - Project Definition

#### Actions Completed

- Created the DFIR lab repository.
- Created the initial project structure.
- Defined Case 01.
- Defined the primary investigation question.
- Defined investigation sub-questions.
- Established lab safety boundaries.
- Established initial evidence-handling principles.
- Created the documentation structure.
- Profiled the host operating system, CPU, memory, storage, and available virtualisation platforms.
- Selected a single-evidence-VM architecture based on available host resources.
- Selected VMware Workstation as the planned hypervisor.
- Identified insufficient available storage as a blocker to VM provisioning.
- Deferred VM creation until sufficient storage capacity is available.
- Verified hardware virtualisation as enabled through Windows Task Manager.
- Confirmed that Windows detects an active hypervisor.

#### Evidence Examined

None.

#### Findings

None.

#### Interpretation

No forensic conclusions can currently be made because forensic evidence has not yet been generated or acquired.

#### Next Step

Resolve the available-storage constraint before provisioning the Windows evidence VM.

After sufficient storage is available, verify VMware guest startup and design the controlled investigation scenario before evidence generation begins.
